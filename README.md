# Siddharth's portfolio

Siddharth has created his portfolio which contains 3 different pages of 3 different routes.

- Route path="/" rendering Home.js

- Route path="/blog" rendering Blog.js

- Route path="/Info" rendering Info.js


But Siddharth is unable to code for the buttons inside the all pages which when clicked will redirect to another route.
Your task is to help Siddhart and implement these functionalities for him.

- In Home.js , if button with id #home-to-info is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/" to Route path="/info"

- In Home.js , if button with id #home-to-blog is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/" to Route path="/blog"


- In Blog.js , if button with id #blog-to-info is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/blog" to Route path="/info"

- In Blog.js , if button with id #blog-to-home is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/blog" to Route path="/"


- In Info.js , if button with id #info-to-blog is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/info" to Route path="/blog"

- In Info.js , if button with id #info-to-home is clicked then the user is redirected from Route path="/info" to Route path="/"
